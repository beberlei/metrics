Thanks @dsantang for this new feature. I appreciate it.

I never used statsd tags, do you have any docs about that? thanks.

Hey @lyrixx, sorry for the delayed response.
It is actually only (I think) for the Telegraf - StatsD implementation.
On this page, the "Introducing Influx StatsD" section shows how to tag StatsD metrics:

Ah Ok. that's why I never hear about that feature.
Because this feature is not part of the standard, I'm a bit reluctant to add it.
May be we can add a new Collector: `Telegraph`. What do you think ?

Yeah, that way we can better separate the concerns.
Altho that will lead to code duplication* **IF** we do not want to re-build the `StatsD` collector as well.
What approach would you suggest?

*(the class `Telegraf` will basically have the same code of `StatsD` with in addition the Tags logic)

If it's possible to extends the code, let's do this.
It it's not possible, I'm totally fine with code duplication.
